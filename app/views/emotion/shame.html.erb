              <div class="emotion">
                  <p>People feel ashamed when they think they or their relatives couldn’t play a role in society properly, their behavior is against some sense of values, such as law or ethics, or they are inferior to others.
For example, you will be ashamed if you couldn’t meet others’ expectations at work or at school, or if you think your or your family’s social status and income is lower than others. However, if you are not valued by or compared to others, you won’t feel ashamed. Thus, shame is a social feeling, which requires the basis that you or your sayings are seen and evaluated by other people.

                  <h1>Methods to relieve</h1>
                  <p>1.
Sometimes people will make a mistake, and cannot get their expected results of game matches, exams or jobs. In this case, it is not bad to recognize your level because it will encourage you to improve yourself more. However, try not to feel ashamed when you make mistakes. If you are ashamed that you couldn’t get a gratifying result, your self-esteem will be lowered and you will unconsciously devalue your ability. Lowering your self-evaluation will lead you to believe yourself as a person who cannot achieve a satisfactory outcome, or a person whose ability is low. If you do so, then your performance will actually be degraded and the chance that you fail and cannot bring out your best will be increased. (tip: comfort zone)
Thus, when you failed, keep in mind to think it is not like you, instead of being shamed. If you do so, your brain will take the situation where you get satisfactory results and you won’t fail for granted, and then you can perform at your full potential.
