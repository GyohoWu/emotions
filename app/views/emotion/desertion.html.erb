                  <p>There are something you should forsake and something you should not.  First, your desires, such as appetite, sex drive, love of money, and possessive instinct should be controlled in moderate because being dominated by desires is not humane. What you should not forsake is your dream. In fact, if a goal is what you really want, people will not give it up. They will not abandon the dream which they really want to attain no matter what. </p>
                  <h1>Methods to relieve</h1>
                  <p>1.
People’s dreams may be to get into good universities, or to join a big company.
However, their dreams are often determined by their parents or teachers. In this case, it is natural that they want to give up their goals.
It might be good to live up to their expectations, but we only live once, so we should do whatever we really want to do. If you are thinking about giving up your goal, consider whether it is what you really desire.
</p>
                  <p>2.
You don’t have to overcome the feeling of giving up. You want to forsake something because it is probably what someone forces you to do so. If it is what you really need or you really want to achieve, you will think about trying it once again even if you want to give it up at first.
Therefore, if you want to forsake something, it is a chance for you to check whether it is valueless or important to you.
